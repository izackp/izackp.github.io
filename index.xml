      <description>R3 AppiPhone &amp;amp; iPadiTunes LinkCommentsThis was also not a very fun app because it was initially outsourced to china and they built the ipad version and iphone version with separate code. Nonetheless, you can take a questionnaire and see your results, find nearby shelters, access information and videos, and subscribe to a mailing list on constant contact via OAuth2. More notably the app is localized to be in spanish too, so if your phone is set to espaneol before you download the app the everything will be in spanish.</description>
